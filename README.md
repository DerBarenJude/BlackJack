AP Computer Science BlackJack Program

##Introduction

BlackJack is a simple Java program for an AP Computer Science class.The program is a playable game of BlackJack in which there is a dealer, player, and deck. The basic Heirarchy of the program follows BlackJack Play. 

Game Rules > Dealer > Player > Shoe > Deck > Hand > Card

Implementation of a GUI is a goal once the basic console game is finished.


###Update 3/12/14:

Project due 3/15/14 and will only include a console version. After the project is turned in the program will continue to be developed with a GUI and bug fixes as priorities. Ideally interfaces and other changes can be implemented once the core game mechanics are finished.
